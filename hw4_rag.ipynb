    "Specific domain knowledge to answer questions like this may not be available in the data that the LLM was pre-trained on. As a result, if we simply prompt the the LLM to answer this question, it may tell us that it does not know the answer, or worse, it may hallucinate an incorrect answer. Even if we are lucky and the LLM has have enough information to answer this question from pre-training, but the information may be outdated (the headmaster is likely to change from time to time). \n",

    "\n",
    "> *The Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. **The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni**, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If we include the context as part of the prompt to the LLM, the model should be able to correctly answer the question (SQuAD contains \"unanswerable questions\", for which the provided context does not provide sufficient information to answer the question -- we will ignore these for the purpose of this assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a scenario in which we don't know which context belongs to which question and we will use **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to identify the relevant context from the set of all available contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we will experiment with the following systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A baseline \"vanilla QA\" system in which we try to answer the question without any additional context (i.e. using the pre-trained LLM only).\n",
    "* An \"oracle\" system, in which we provide the correct context for each question. This establishes an upper bound for the retrieval approaches. \n",
    "* Two different approaches for retrieving relevant contexts:\n",
    "  * based on token overlap between the question and each context.\n",
    "  * based on cosine similarity between question embeddings and candidate context embeddings (obtained using BERT).\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will evaluate each system using a number of metrics commonly used for QA tasks: \n",
    "* Exact Match (EM), which measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match the ground truth answers.\n",
    "* F1 score, measured on the token overlap between the predicted and ground truth answers.\n",
    "* ROUGE (specifically, ROUGE2)\n",
